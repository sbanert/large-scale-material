  and articles cover the course contents and provide further material
  for you if you want to know more about the topics.
** Textbooks
   + [[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-48311-5][H.H. Bauschke, P.L. Combettes: Convex Analysis and Monotone Operator Theory in Hilbert Spaces, Springer (2017)]]
     
     Convex analysis in (possibly infinite-dimensional) Hilbert
     spaces, Fenchel duality and proximal algorithms.

     Contains more general conditions which ensure strong duality.
